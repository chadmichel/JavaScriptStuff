// this pattern has some advantages
// 1. functions are not created for each new class. This saves memory.
// 2. gives us the ability to have public and private members. (other patterns have this too).

// As a con this pattern seems somewhat odd. adding methods occurs outside the Car function.

var Car = function(engine) {
 
    this.engine = engine;
 
};

Car.prototype = function() {
    
    // private methods
    var start = function() {
        alert('start engine ' + this.engine);
    },
 
    stop = function () {
        alert('stop engine ' + this.engine);
    };
 
    // public methods, can be named differently
    return {
       start: start,
       stop: stop
    };

// extend (override start)
Car.prototype.start = function() {
