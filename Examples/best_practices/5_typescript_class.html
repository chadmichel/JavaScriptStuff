// this pattern has some advantages
// 1. functions are not created for each new class. This saves memory.
// 2. gives us the ability to have public and private members. (other patterns have this too).

// As a con this pattern seems somewhat odd. adding methods occurs outside the Car function.

var Car = (function() {
 
    function Car(engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
